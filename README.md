    Marsupials are an infraclass of mammals living primarily in Australasia 
    and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic, common to many species,
    is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials 
    include kangaroos, wallabies, the koala, possums, opossums, wombats and 
    the Tasmanian devil.

    We like keeping things in pouches, so they can't make such a mess. Much
    like objects and private variables.
